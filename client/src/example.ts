          '"[The anti-testing] movement now has a guidebook. . . . Kamenetz shows how fundamentally American it would be to move toward a more holistic system." -- New York Times Book Review The Test is an essential and critically acclaimed book for any parent confounded by our national obsession with standardized testing. It recounts the shocking history and tempestuous politics of testing and borrows strategies from fields as diverse as games, neuroscience, and ancient philosophy to help children cope. It presents the stories of families, teachers, and schools maneuvering within and beyond the existing educational system, playing and winning the testing game. And it points the way toward a hopeful future of better tests and happier kids.',

          "Includes the complete TOEFL CBT Testbuster plus CD-ROM with CBT software (computer based tests.) In a computer adaptive test, the computer automatically \"adapts\" the test to the test- taker's performance. Questions get harder or easier depending on how the preceding question is answered. Scoring is based on how many of the more difficult questions are answered correctly. REA's CBT software thoroughly prepares students for this computer adaptive test. Outsmart the TOEFL CBT and raise your score with the proven testbuster strategies and techniques of the leading national coach and review courses. You get the best of the best coaching wisdom and test-taking strategies that have proven to raise test scores. Reviews are specifically tailored to the subject matter covered on the test so you don't waste time studying irrelevant material. Test questions are broken down and analyzed, with specific techniques to help you answer more questions in less time. Strategies and tips are presented that enable you to answer questions quicker and easier on all sections of the TOEFL: Listening Comprehension, Reading Comprehension, Structure and Written Expression. The testbuster teaches you to attack any question that may appear on the TOEFL CBT by capitalizing on the structure and very basis of the TOEFL CBT content. Specific strategies are taught to help you score higher on all areas of the TOEFL CBT. Four full-length diagnostic tests are included to help you determine your strengths and weaknesses. Also includes REA's Verbal Builder software to build vocabulary and reading skills. The CD-ROM works on Windows and Macintosh computers. Suitable for any PC with 16 MB of RAM minimum. Any Macintosh with a 68020 or higher processor, 16 MB of RAM minimum, System 7.1 or later.",

        description:
          "In recognition of the trend toward using numerical methdos for analyzing aquifer test data, Aquifer Test Modeling delineates the application of numerical Laplace inversion analytical equations and numerical models and demonstrates the use of public domain software. Written by a leading expert with over fifty years of experience, this highly practical text provides a thorough grounding in the terms and methods employed in aquifer test modeling, while also establishing a protocol for organizing and simplifying conceptual model definition and data analysis. Using graphs, tables, and sample datasets to enhance understanding, the author delineates the five major steps involved in the aquifer test modeling process. He discusses the importance of the conceptual model definition as a framework for organizing, simplifying, and idealizing information. The chapters cover the selection of appropriate aquifer test mathematical model equations compatible with previously defined conceptual models and highlight the importance of reviewing the mathematical assumption and the adjustment of data for any departures. They also explain format selection, technique selection, well function or drawdown calculation, and calibration. The book provides five sample data sets to assist the reader in becoming familiar with WTAQ and MODFLOW aquifer test modeling input and output data file contents with confined nonleaky and unconfined aquifer conditions. It includes conceptual models consisting of abbreviated descriptions of aquifer test facilities, aquifer test data, and aquifer parameter values together with selected sample file sets. These are just a few of the features that make the book a valuable tool for estimating the supply and contamination characteristics of aquifers.",
